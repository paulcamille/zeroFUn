______________about this program_______________


I have impleted three methods to compute the zero of a given funtion. 
We use a class SolverOption to store the parameter of the computation, a struct SolverResult to store the result of the computation. Then there is solverFactory where we can choose the method. Finaly, the paramters coulb be modify in the data.dat file and we use muparseer the consert the strings as value (double, function etc...) 




first step : make all
second step : ./main_getpot_muparser.cpp

OR

the bash script ./autorun.sh can directly execute the program
